        <h1>Benefit of using google ads</h1>
        
        <h3> 1. The marketing world has changed dramatically in recent years, and Google Ads is one of the platforms driving this
        transformation. Indeed, Google Ads is one of the most effective methods of paid online advertising.</h3>
        
        <h3> 2. Google Ads allows businesses to reach anyone who uses Google to search for information, products and services online.
        When used properly, Google Ads has the potential to send you large numbers of people who want exactly what you have to
        offer.</h3>
        
        <h3> 3. Adwords works faster than SEO</h3>
        
        <p> The topmost benefit of Google AdWords is that it works faster than SEO. Both SEO and Google AdWords are search engine
        marketing strategies to generate more traffic and leads. But, a well optimized AdWords campaign can work much faster for
        a business to get the much coveted first spot in search.<br>
        
        Here are some reasons why it’s faster and more effective</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You can focus on multiple keywords at a time.</li>
            <li>You can turn the campaign on or off whenever you want to.</li>
            <li>Ads which appears on the top of the page get immediate visibility</li>
        </ul>
       
       
       
        
         <h3>4. Increase brand awareness </h3>
        <p> Google AdWords, in addition to boosting traffic, clicks, and conversions, is also an efficient way to tell people about<br>
        your brand. To verify this, Google partnered with Ipsos to run a study across 12 verticals, right from automobiles to<br>
        retail. It was discovered that search ads lift top-of-mind awareness by an average of 6.6%.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Measure your performance consistently</h3>
            <p>It is very difficult to measure the outcome of traditional advertisements like newspapers, radio, broadcast television,
                cable television, outdoor billboards, brochures etc. Also, they are much more expensive than Google AdWords. You can’t
                control your own budget and spend. Additionally, you wouldn’t know the source of the leads coming from these media,
                unless your customer chooses to divulge it. As a result, it would be very difficult to calculate ROI from traditional
                media.<br>
                But, AdWords, on the other hand, would tell you exactly what happened with the campaign. You would know:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Who clicked on your ad.</li>
                <li>How many leads have been generated.</li>
                <li>How much traffic you have got from AdWords to your website<</li>
                <li>Which keyword generated the most traffic and leads.</li>
                <li>How much does it cost you per lead.</li>
            </ul></p>
        
         <h3>6. Tackle your competition better</h3>

         <ul>
             <li>When someone searches for something related to your product/services online, and you aren’t running ads, but your
            competitors are, then that means trouble for you. You’ll lose business almost instantly.</li>
             <li>You need to keep an eye on them to see how they are promoting their business, what kinds of ads they run etc. The
            transparent system of Google AdWords helps you do this. Grab the opportunities that come your way and make yourself
            stand out from your competition.</li>
         </ul>
